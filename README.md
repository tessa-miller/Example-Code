This is a set of example code that I have written for various class and research projects.
Quick guide to various projects:
 Lab_11.m: MAtlab, Animating the first 6 modes for a standing pressure wave
 example_method_of_relaxation.m, Matlab, Animating the method of relaxation to solve a 2D wave function. Based on Problem 3.65 in David Griffith's Introduction to   Electrodynamics
 magnetic_velocity_verlet.m, Matlab, My attempt at taking problem 5.66 in Griffith's Introduction to Electrodynamics and converting it from Mathematica to Matlab
 Lab 15: A Lab in our Computational Physics class. Our teacher took audio data of generic noise with a professional wind screen and with a set of standard foam balls. The goal of the lab was to use basic signal processing techniques to determine if the foam balls matched the standards of professional windscreens.
