This is a set of example code that I have written for various class and research projects.

Quick guide to various projects:

 Lab_11.m: Matlab, Animating the first 6 modes for a standing pressure wave
 
 example_method_of_relaxation.m, Matlab, Animating the method of relaxation to solve a 2D wave function. Based on Problem 3.65 in David Griffith's Introduction to   Electrodynamics
 
 magnetic_velocity_verlet.m, Matlab, My attempt at taking problem 5.66 in Griffith's Introduction to Electrodynamics and converting it from Mathematica to Matlab
 
 Lab 15: A Lab in our Computational Physics class. Our teacher took audio data of generic noise with a professional wind screen and with a set of standard foam balls. The goal of the lab was to use basic signal processing techniques to determine if the foam balls matched the standards of professional windscreens. The provided audio files are missing, but I think it's a good enough example of my skills to still show here. binfileload.m is code provided to us by the professor to load data in files quickly and efficiently. 

 ece_101_project.ino: Arduino IDE, Simple project in a beginers electrical engineering class. Project was to make an arduino setup that would turn the lights off if there was nobody in the room, and turn the lights on when there were people.

 F24HWK3Tessa_uncorrupted.nb: Mathematica Notebook. Standard Mathematical Physics homework. Included only to show that I have experience with Mathematica.
